# database-management-system
My partner and I created a basic database management system in Java using IntelliJ IDEA. Weâ€™ve implemented the core modules required to access stored data on the disk, page eviction policy in the buffer pool, B+ tree structure, etc. The database also features support for various query processing operators, transactions, locking, and concurrent queries.
